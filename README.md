# TicTacToe
Made a C++ tic tac toe that operates inside of the console window

## Next steps
- Give it its own GUI using SDL2
- Entering letters does not cause an error catch

The beginnings of a GUI have been implemented. A board is successfully drawn, as well as the X. There is no native function for drawing circles, and thus a circle drawing function needs to be implemented before further progress can be made.
